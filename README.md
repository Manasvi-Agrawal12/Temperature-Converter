# Temperature-Converter
Welcome to the Temperature Converter Website! This platform is dedicated to simplifying temperature conversions. There are four main temperature scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine. Our website allows you to effortlessly convert between these scales without the hassle of manual calculations.
In CSS there are five generic font families:  Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.(Times New Roman,Georgia,Garamond etc)  Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.  Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look.  Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.   Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
